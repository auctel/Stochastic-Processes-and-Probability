# Stochastic Processes and Probability

This repository contains projects, simulations, and snippets of code I have on myriad topics pertaining to stochastic processes. 

coal-sim - Coalescence Theory Simulations 

## More to come later: 
mark-op - Markov Chain Optimizer 
rw-sim - Random Walk Simulation 
gambly - Gamblerâ€™s Ruin Monte Carlo Simulation 
stoch-de - Stochastic Differential Equation Solver 
brown-bridges - Brownian Bridge Simulations
hidden-mmi - Hidden Markov Model Inference

Please fork the repo if you use my code.
